I'm a programmer and hobbyist hacker from the SF bay area. I enjoy building high performance open-source systems from inexpensive, low power and/or EOL hardware.

This blag is largely for my own reference, I find that if I don't keep a work log the fiddly details get lost by the time I need to reference the project again.
