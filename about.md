![blag about it on your wobsite](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/mispronouncing.png){: style="float: right; padding: 20px" }

I'm a hobbyist hacker from the SF bay area.

I enjoy building high performance systems from inexpensive, low power and EOL hardware using open source software.

This blag is where I collect projects that I've worked on that could be useful to someone else. Sort of like /r/homelab, but with less stanning for Unifi products and fewer network diagrams.
